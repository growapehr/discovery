# Discovery üè•

> Discovering and solving the problem space of patient-centered Electronic Health Record (EHR) system using **peer-to-peer (P2P) technology**

## üéØ Mission

This repository serves as a collaborative space for identifying, documenting, and solving real-world problems in healthcare that stem from the lack of patient-centralized Electronic Health Records. Our goal is to understand the current pain points and develop innovative **P2P solutions** that put patients at the center of their healthcare data using the **Pear and Holepunch technology stack**.

## üîó Technology Stack

**Powered by Pear & Holepunch P2P Platform**

- **[Pear](https://pear.to)** - P2P application development platform enabling direct patient-to-patient connections
- **[Holepunch](https://holepunch.to)** - Distributed networking infrastructure for secure, serverless health data sharing
- **Patient Data Sovereignty** - Cryptographically secure, patient-controlled health records
- **Direct Peer Connections** - Eliminate intermediaries and data silos through true P2P architecture

### üìã 1_Problems/

**Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation of problems in current healthcare systems due to the absence of patient-centralized, P2P EHR.

- **`problems/`** - Systematic identification of systemic issues in healthcare
- **`user_stories/`** - Real-world scenarios from healthcare users' perspectives, focusing on touchpoints where **P2P solutions** could make a difference

### üí° 2_Solutions/

**Purpose**: Define **peer-to-peer solutions** to identified problems using the **Pear and Holepunch stack** with careful consideration of cross-impact between different user scenarios.

> **Important**: When proposing P2P solutions, consider how addressing one user story's problems might affect or exacerbate issues in other scenarios. For example: "Can the P2P solution for data record access for the first 18 years of life also work for the last 18 years?"

### üé® 3_Comics/

**Purpose**: AI-generated comic strips that visualize **P2P healthcare solutions** in action, making complex peer-to-peer concepts accessible to all stakeholders.

- **`problems/`** - Visual illustrations of current healthcare data silos
- **`solutions/`** - Comics showing P2P technology transforming care
- **`user_journeys/`** - Complete before/after stories using Pear/Holepunch
- **`technical/`** - Accessible explanations of P2P healthcare concepts

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Explore the Problems**: Start by reviewing existing problems and user stories in `1_Problems/`
2. **Understand P2P Solutions**: Review how peer-to-peer technology addresses healthcare challenges in `2_Solutions/`
3. **Visualize the Future**: See P2P healthcare in action through comics in `3_Comics/`
4. **Contribute**: Add your own experiences, problems, or P2P solutions following the established structure

## ü§ù How to Contribute

We welcome contributions that help us better understand and solve healthcare challenges through **P2P technology**! Here's how you can help:

### Adding Problems

- Document systemic issues in `1_Problems/problems/`
- Share real-world experiences in `1_Problems/user_stories/`
- Focus on problems caused by lack of **patient-controlled, P2P** EHR

### Proposing P2P Solutions

- Reference specific problems being solved
- Leverage **Pear and Holepunch capabilities**
- Consider cross-impact on other user scenarios
- Think holistically about **patient data sovereignty**

### Creating Visual Stories

- Generate AI comics that illustrate P2P concepts
- Show transformation from data silos to patient control
- Make peer-to-peer technology accessible to all audiences

### Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Provide concrete examples and scenarios
- Consider the **patient-as-sovereign** perspective in all contributions
- Reference related problems/solutions when applicable
- Emphasize **direct peer connections** and **data ownership**

## üé® Methodology

Our approach follows a structured P2P discovery process:

1. **Problem Identification** ‚Üí Document real-world healthcare challenges
2. **User Story Development** ‚Üí Capture patient and provider experiences
3. **P2P Solution Design** ‚Üí Develop peer-to-peer solutions using Pear/Holepunch
4. **Visual Communication** ‚Üí Create comics that illustrate P2P transformations
5. **Cross-Impact Analysis** ‚Üí Ensure P2P solutions don't create new problems
