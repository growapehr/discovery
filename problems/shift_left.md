# Shift Left

## Problem
One metric that Public Health England had as an early intervention KPI was the number of diabetic foot amputations. Why? Because when a foot is amputated it’s diabetes where the intervention wasn’t far enough to the left. What if they’d had a mental health intervention or social prescribing from primary care. Or an alcohol councillor.

**At a system level they’re trying to stop people from ending up in hospital because beds and wards are expensive. Better to make early interventions to reduce demand.**

You can’t follow a patients path through the system if each piece of the jigsaw is disintegrating over multiple providers.

A joined up EHR allows for better planning of services because it’s a patient centric approach.

## What are the Benefits of P2P?
TL;DR - patient centric EHr isn’t just good for the patient, it’s good for the service designers because it makes multi disciplinary teams function more smoothly.
Shift the intervention "left" by making more care providers able to discover and intervene on known - but not shared - issues.
This can reduce demand on hospitals and support KPIs related to this.

## What NHS targets could be met by P2P?
TBD - Reference needed if available

## Other Examples
* Another example is South London has a massive cannabis induced psychosis problem. That’s expensive when it gets to that point. If you can’t follow a use some of that resource to educate people about the new strains of high THC bud then you don’t have all the disasterous and expensive downstream effects.
