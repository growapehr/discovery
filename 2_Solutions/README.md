> Developing **patient-centralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) solutions** using Pear and Holepunch to transform healthcare delivery

## üéØ Mission

Define innovative **peer-to-peer (P2P) solutions** to documented healthcare problems using the **Pear and Holepunch technology stack**, with careful consideration of cross-impact between different user scenarios. Our solutions focus on putting patients at the center of their healthcare data through **data sovereignty** while ensuring providers have the information they need for optimal care delivery.

## üèóÔ∏è Solution Development Framework

### Core Principles

- **Patient Data Sovereignty** - Patients cryptographically own and control their health data using P2P technology
- **Peer-to-Peer Architecture** - Direct connections using Pear/Holepunch, eliminating intermediaries
- **Secure & Private** - Protects sensitive health information with distributed encryption
- **User-Friendly** - Intuitive for patients and providers alike across all devices
- **Truly Decentralized** - Can work from individual use to healthcare system-wide adoption without central servers

### Design Methodology

1. **Problem-First Approach** - Start with specific documented problems
2. **P2P-Centered Design** - Leverage Pear/Holepunch capabilities for all stakeholders
3. **Cross-Impact Analysis** - Ensure P2P solutions don't create new problems
4. **Iterative Development** - Build, test, refine based on real-world P2P feedback

## üîÑ Cross-Impact Consideration

> **Critical Question**: Can the solution for one user story also work for other scenarios?

### Impact Assessment Framework

For each solution, evaluate:

#### Positive Cross-Effects

- Which other problems does this solution address?
- What secondary benefits emerge?
- How does it improve the overall healthcare ecosystem?

#### Potential Negative Impacts

- Could this solution exacerbate problems in other user stories?
- What new challenges might it create?
- Are there unintended consequences for different user groups?

#### Example Analysis

> "Can the solution for data record access for the first 18 years of life also work for the last 18 years?"

Consider factors like:

- Cognitive ability changes over time
- Technology adoption differences
- Family involvement variations
- Privacy expectation evolution
- Medical complexity differences
