# Whole Person Care - Interconnected Health Management

## User Profile

- **Age**: 35-65 years old
- **Demographics**: Patient managing multiple long-term conditions
- **Health status**: Diabetes, mental health challenges, substance use patterns
- **Technology comfort level**: Moderate - comfortable with basic digital health tools
- **Healthcare context**: Multiple providers across physical health, mental health, and social services

## Current Journey

### The Scenario

A patient managing multiple interconnected health conditions needs care that understands and treats them as a whole person, not as disconnected issues handled in isolation.

### Touchpoints

- **GP visits**: Discuss physical health but mental health context missing
- **Mental health services**: Unaware of physical health complications affecting treatment
- **Specialist appointments**: Isolated focus without full health picture
- **Emergency care**: Crisis interventions when connections between conditions missed
- **Social services**: Addressing symptoms without understanding root health connections

### Pain Points

- **Starting from scratch** at every provider interaction
- **Repeating medical history** across disconnected services
- **No one sees the full picture** because data is spread across different services
- **Missing early intervention opportunities** due to lack of context
- **Crisis-driven care** when interconnected issues escalate

### Workarounds

- Personal health journals to track connections between conditions
- Bringing family members to appointments for context
- Coordinating between providers manually
- Seeking care only when conditions reach crisis point

## Critical Moments

### P2P Intervention Points

Where could **patient-centralized, peer-to-peer data** using Pear/Holepunch have helped?

- **Holistic provider view**: All care teams see complete health picture including interconnections
- **Pattern recognition**: Data analysis reveals connections between mental health, substance use, and diabetes management
- **Early intervention triggers**: Providers can identify and address issues before crisis escalation
- **Coordinated care planning**: All providers working from same comprehensive health record

### Potential Impact

How would the experience change with **patient-controlled, P2P health records**?
