> Systematic identification of healthcare issues caused by non-patient-centralized, **P2P EHR systems**

## üéØ Purpose

Document any and all systemic problems that exist in current healthcare due to not using a **patient-centralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) Electronic Health Record system** built on technologies like Pear and Holepunch. This directory focuses on structural, operational, and technological challenges that affect healthcare delivery at scale.

## üè• Problem Examples

### Data Fragmentation Issues

- Health records scattered across multiple systems
- Incomplete medical histories
- Duplicate testing and procedures
- Missing critical information during emergencies

### Provider Communication Breakdowns

- Inadequate care coordination between specialists
- Medication reconciliation failures
- Treatment plan disconnects
- Referral information gaps

### Patient Access & Control

- Patients unable to access their own complete health records
- Lack of data portability between providers
- Limited patient involvement in care decisions
- Difficulty sharing records with new providers

### System Inefficiencies

- Administrative burden from multiple EHR systems
- Time wasted on data entry and retrieval
- Resource duplication across healthcare networks
- Interoperability challenges

## üîç Research Methodology

### Problem Discovery Sources

- Healthcare provider interviews
- Patient experience surveys
- Clinical research papers
- Healthcare system reports
- Medical error studies
- Industry analysis reports

### Validation Criteria

- **Verifiable**: Problem can be confirmed through multiple sources
- **Significant**: Has meaningful impact on patient care or system efficiency
- **Addressable**: Could potentially be solved through **patient-centralized, P2P EHR** using Pear/Holepunch
- **Specific**: Well-defined scope and boundaries

## üìä Problem Prioritization Framework

### High Priority

- Life-threatening situations
- Widespread occurrence
- High financial impact
- Clear path to **patient-centralized, P2P solution**

### Medium Priority

- Quality of care impacts
- Provider workflow issues
- Moderate system inefficiencies
- Complex but solvable challenges

### Research Needed

- Emerging issues
- Unclear scope or impact
- Requires further investigation
- Potential future problems

## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

### Before Adding a Problem

1. Search existing problems to avoid duplicates
2. Ensure it relates to lack of **patient-centralized, P2P EHR**
3. Gather sufficient evidence and examples
4. Consider the scope and specificity

### Writing Quality Standards

- Use clear, jargon-free language
- Provide concrete examples
- Include quantitative data when available
- Reference credible sources
- Focus on systemic rather than individual issues

### Cross-Referencing

- Link to related user stories in `../user_stories/`
- Reference proposed solutions in `../../2_Solutions/`
- Connect to other related problems

## üé® Problem Mapping

Consider how problems interconnect:

- **Upstream Issues** - Root causes that create multiple downstream problems
- **Downstream Effects** - Consequences that cascade from core issues
- **Lateral Connections** - Problems that influence each other
- **Solution Dependencies** - Problems that must be solved together

---

üéØ **Goal**: Build a comprehensive map of healthcare challenges that **patient-centralized, P2P EHR systems** using Pear and Holepunch could address, prioritized by impact and solvability.
