# Shift Left - Early Intervention Failures

## Problem Statement

Healthcare systems struggle to implement early interventions because patient data is fragmented across multiple providers, preventing care teams from seeing patterns that could enable preventive care and reduce costly hospital admissions.

## Current State

Healthcare providers measure success through metrics like diabetic foot amputations - but these represent failures of early intervention. When a foot is amputated, it's diabetes where the intervention wasn't far enough to the left. What if they'd had a mental health intervention or social prescribing from primary care, or an alcohol counselor?

At a system level, they're trying to stop people from ending up in hospital because beds and wards are expensive. Better to make early interventions to reduce demand. However, you can't follow a patient's path through the system if each piece of the jigsaw is disintegrating over multiple providers.

## Contributing Factors

- **Technology limitations**: Siloed EHR systems preventing comprehensive patient view
- **Organizational challenges**: Disconnected care teams and service providers
- **Policy/regulatory barriers**: Data sharing restrictions between organizations
- **Financial constraints**: Incentive structures favor reactive rather than preventive care

## Impact Assessment

### On Patients

- **Health outcomes**: Preventable complications and hospitalizations
- **Experience quality**: Crisis-driven rather than preventive care approach
- **Financial burden**: Higher costs from emergency interventions vs. early prevention

### On Providers

- **Workflow disruption**: Inability to coordinate care across multiple services
- **Clinical decision-making**: Incomplete patient context limiting intervention opportunities
- **Time and resource costs**: Reactive treatment more expensive than prevention

### On Healthcare System

- **Overall efficiency**: High hospital utilization due to failed early intervention
- **Cost implications**: Emergency care significantly more expensive than prevention
- **Quality metrics**: Poor performance on early intervention KPIs

## P2P EHR Connection

**Patient-controlled, peer-to-peer health records** using Pear/Holepunch would enable a joined-up EHR that allows for better planning of services through a patient-centric approach. P2P systems would shift the intervention "left" by making more care providers able to discover and intervene on known - but not shared - issues. This can reduce demand on hospitals and support KPIs related to early intervention.

## Real-World Examples

- **Diabetic foot amputations**: Preventable through earlier mental health, social prescribing, or addiction support
- **Cannabis-induced psychosis**: South London has a massive problem that's expensive when it reaches crisis point. Early education about high THC strains could prevent costly downstream effects
- **Multi-condition patients**: Mental health, substance use, and physical health conditions interconnected but treated in isolation

## Severity & Frequency

- **How often**: Affects majority of patients with chronic or complex conditions
- **Severity of impact**: High - results in preventable hospitalizations, amputations, and crisis interventions
- **Patient populations most affected**: Patients with multiple chronic conditions, mental health challenges, substance use disorders, social determinants of health
