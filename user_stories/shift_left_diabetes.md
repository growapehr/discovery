🧍‍♂️ User

A patient managing multiple long-term conditions (e.g. diabetes, mental health, substance use)

🎯 Goal

To receive care that understands and treats me as a whole person — not as disconnected issues handled in isolation.

🧱 Problem

When I show up at the GP, I talk about my physical health. But they might not know I’ve been struggling with depression.
If I see a mental health worker, they might not know I’m drinking more because of pain and financial stress.
Nobody connects the dots until something serious happens — like losing my foot to diabetes. Or ending up in hospital with psychosis.

Every time I interact with a part of the NHS, I have to start from scratch. I get tired of repeating myself. Some things fall through the cracks. And I don’t even know which service is supposed to help with what.

By the time I get the help I really need, it’s often too late — and much worse than it had to be.

🔍 What’s Broken
	•	My health and life challenges are interconnected, but the system treats them separately
	•	No one sees the full picture because my data is spread across different services
	•	I miss out on early help because no one has the context to offer it
	•	I only get attention when I hit crisis point — when it’s painful, scary, and harder to fix

🔁 What Peer-to-Peer Records Could Do

If my health and care record moved with me — and every provider could see and contribute to it — I’d feel:
	•	Known — I don’t have to repeat my story
	•	Understood — patterns between my physical and mental health would be visible
	•	Supported — services could work together earlier to help me avoid crisis

✅ What Success Looks Like for Me
	•	I get help before things escalate
	•	My care feels connected, not like a maze
	•	Different professionals talk to each other, so I don’t have to coordinate everything myself
	•	I feel like a person, not a file
