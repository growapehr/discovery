🧩 User Story: I Want Control of My Health Info as I Grow Up

🧒 User

A child growing into a young adult, starting with parental support and later seeking privacy and independence in health matters

🎯 Goal

To have my parent manage my health records when I’m young — but be able to take control of my own data, especially when it comes to private or sensitive healthcare as I get older.

👶 My Early Years

When I was little, my mum took me to the GP, booked appointments, kept track of my vaccines, and talked to doctors for me. That made sense — I didn’t understand any of it.

But all my medical stuff was hers to manage, not mine. I didn’t have access, or even know what was in it.

👧 Becoming a Teen

Now I’m 15, and I’m starting to deal with my own health stuff. I might want to go to an STI clinic. I might want to ask questions about contraception or mental health.

But if all my health records still go through my parent, I can’t get private advice. I might not go at all — which could be dangerous for me.

🎓 Turning 16–18

At 16, I should be able to:
	•	Make some health decisions on my own
	•	Share just part of my record (e.g. STI test results) with a clinician
	•	Keep some visits or info private from my parents if it’s allowed by law

Then, when I turn 18, I want:
	•	Full control of my health record
	•	To be able to revoke or continue access for my parent, just like I would for anyone else

⸻

🔍 What’s Broken in Today’s Systems
	•	Records are either fully parent-managed or fully locked — there’s no gradual handover
	•	Sensitive health access can be blocked by rigid systems or fear of disclosure
	•	Teens don’t have a trusted way to privately access and share just what they need
	•	Once I turn 18, switching control is clunky or doesn’t happen at all

⸻

🔁 What Peer-to-Peer Records Could Enable
	•	Delegated access: My parent manages my health record by default — but it’s still my record
	•	Age-aware permissions: At 16, I can start making choices — sharing certain data, hiding others
	•	Private, direct sharing: I can give a sexual health clinic access to only what’s needed, just for that appointment
	•	Seamless transition: At 18, control transfers fully to me with no data loss or admin hassle

⸻

✅ What Success Looks Like for Me
	•	I feel safe asking for help with sensitive health issues
	•	I’m not forced to choose between getting care and keeping things private
	•	My parent helps me when I’m young, but respects my independence as I grow
	•	My health record grows with me — and stays mine
