## Present
Alex - Chairing
Kevin - Project Manager
Dominic - CTO of software outsourcing firm, range of IT experience, came in through Keet

## Endpoint
Objective is to persuade key decision-makers in health system to switch to this option
Getting a proof-of-concept to non-technical audience, showing it'll work better than a huge centralised patient record
Create a P2P protocol for sharing medical records

## MVP Discussion
* openEHR (data storage format) integration - Need to be able to convert HyperDB data to openEHR standard files for sharing
* FHIR (interface) - API for ingress and egress of data for the old world https://github.com/holepunchto/hypercore-blob-server
* Need to expose some UI for exploring the MVP to the old world
* Need to be able to demonstrate that oAuth2 can be integrated with P2P
* What do we want to demo? How much will users be able to play with in a demo to explore
* Demo needs to show clearly and visually that the user owns the data
  * Different web pages that are windows to different user accounts
  * Let us show visually that the different "users" have their own data, and can real-time share data with each other
 
## Who are the key holders?
Demo is aimed at the keyholders in the NHS
Open minded individuals outside the NHS that have strong connections to keyholders

## NHS 10 Year Plan
* "Integrated" Neighbourhood Teams" - "shift left" is a big focus on reducing the number of patients that reach hospitals and doctors = bed's cost money

## Action
* Alex to add Waypoints to notes
* Discovery to be expanded on with user stories and funnel to solutions we can build into the MVP and Demo
* NHS 10 Year Plan need to be fully understood
